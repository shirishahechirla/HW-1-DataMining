def question10_1():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification: Noise can be an issue with count data because there can be random variations or errors present in the counts.
    return answer

def question10_2():
    answer: bool= True
    #justification:The correlation is a number between -1 and 1, showing how much and in what direction two sets of values are related.
    return answer

def question10_3():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification:Aggregating a daily time series is often better for reducing size as it combines data over time intervals, preserving more information compared to simple sampling, which may lead to information loss.
    return answer

def question10_4():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification: Noise and outliers are not the same; noise refers to random variations or errors in data, while outliers are distinct data points that deviate significantly from the majority and may indicate anomalies or errors in the data collection process.
    return answer

def question10_5():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification:An object being an outlier does not necessarily mean it is noise; outliers can be indicative of important information, anomalies, or errors, and they should be examined in context rather than automatically considered noise.
    return answer

def question10_6():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification:A binary attribute with values 0 or 1 is considered asymmetric if the values have different meanings or importance, but the statement is not explicitly clear on this distinction.
    return answer

def question10_7():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification: A cosine measure of 1 indicates that vectors of counts are perfectly aligned, but it does not necessarily mean the objects are identical. Objects could have different magnitudes while still having a cosine similarity of 1.
    return answer

def question10_8():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification:Discrete variables can be ratio variables if they have a true zero point, where zero represents the absence of the quantity being measured. For example, counts of items or occurrences can be discrete ratio variables.
    return answer

def question10_9():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification:Quantitative variables can be either discrete or continuous. Discrete quantitative variables take distinct, separate values, while continuous quantitative variables can take any value within a given range.
    return answer

def question10_10():
    answer: bool = False
    #justification: Converting ordinal variables to asymmetric binary variables can result in information loss, as it simplifies the ordinal relationship into binary form, disregarding the original order and distinctions between different levels of the ordinal variable.
    return answer
